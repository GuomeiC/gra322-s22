      <h3>Dedicated to Quality </h3>
      <p>FWe pride ourselves on providing organic, fair trade tea and coffee. We work with local dairies and bakeries to source the freshest and tastiest additions to your coffee.Caffeine, the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in the world, is the best-known ingredient of coffee. Its beneficial effects on the human body have been researched quite well, but coffee as a whole is a complex beverage with a thousand different substances. Some studies argue that decaf and caffeinated coffee may have the same health effects and suggest that itâ€™s not the caffeine that is responsible for most of coffee's health benefits.</p>
